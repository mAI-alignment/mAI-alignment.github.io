David is a PhD student at the University of Bonn under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Lucie Flek since August 2024. His current research interests include large language model (LLM)-based web agents and planning algorithms to enhance LLMs' reasoning and problem solving capabilities.

**Research Interests:**
- LLM agents
- Planning with LLMs
- Conversational agents
- Reinforcement learning in NLP

**Background:**
David focuses on developing intelligent agents that can effectively navigate and interact with web environments, while also exploring how planning algorithms can improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models. He is also interested in conversational agents and applications of reinforcement learning in natural language processing.
