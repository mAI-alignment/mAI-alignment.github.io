The mAI alignment lab is founded! Dr. Florian Mai started as a Junior Research Group Leader at University of Bonn as part of the [CAISA lab](https://caisa-lab.github.io/) headed by Prof. Lucie Flek. The lab's research will focus on AI safety topics like value alignment, and on reasoning and planning approaches for LLMs.
