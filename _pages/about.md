## About

Welcome to the mAI alignment lab, a Junior Research Group at the University of Bonn led by Dr. Florian Mai.

Our research focuses on AI alignment and safety issues, exploring how to ensure that current and future advanced AI systems are acting reliably in accordance with human values.

## Research Interests

- Scalable Oversight
- Value alignment
- Emergent misalignment
- Planning
- LLM training

## Current Projects

- **[Scalable Oversight by Learning to Decompose Tasks](/projects/superalignment-task-decomposition/)**: Exploring how AI systems can learn to break complex tasks into manageable subtasks for reliable human oversight, advancing the frontier of superalignment research.

- **[Learning to Plan from Unlabeled Data](/projects/learning-to-plan/)**: Developing planning capabilities for language models through self-supervised learning.

## Join Us

We currently have no open positions available. However, if you are interested in collaborating with our research group, please feel free to send an email to Dr. Florian Mai at fmai@uni-bonn.de.
